## 1. The Agency Creative: "Hunting for the Edge" (Commercial Mode)

*   **Persona:** "Ploy" (32), Agency Producer looking for a production house with strong design aesthetics for a new Energy Drink campaign.
*   **Opening Scene:** Ploy is stressed. Her client wants something "raw" and "energetic" (Brutal & High Energy). She's looked at 10 competitors but only found boring, flat portfolios.
*   **Rising Action:** She clicks a link to 56konfilm recommended by a colleague.
    *   *First Impression:* Site loads instantly (LCP < 2.5s) with a solid black background and a fast-paced showreel loop playing full screen.
    *   *Interaction:* She scrolls (scrub interaction) and sees large text "WE SHOOT HARD" running across the screen smoothly (60fps).
*   **Climax:**
    *   She clicks into the "Work Detail" page of a racing car project. The video plays continuously without stutter. She sees a production breakdown in a magazine-style layout, not just a grid.
    *   She feels "wowed" by the taste and presentation, which feels more like a fashion film than a corporate video.
*   **Resolution:** Ploy clicks "Contact" (clearly labeled for Commercial inquiry) and sends the brief immediately, pasting the link in her team Slack saying, "Found it. This is the one."

## 2. The Modern Couple: "The Emotional Connection" (Wedding Mode)

*   **Persona:** "Toey & Beam" (28), Gen-Z couple looking for a wedding videographer with a minimal & warm theme.
*   **Opening Scene:** They receive the link from a friend, but land on the "Commercial Mode" (dark, raw) homepage. They pause, thinking, "Is this the right link? It looks scary."
*   **Rising Action:**
    *   *The Switch:* Toey notices the toggle button at the top right labeled "Wedding Mode". She clicks it.
    *   *Transformation:* The screen fades from black to a soft Cream/Beige. Fonts change from thick Sans-serif to elegant Serif. Aggressive music fades into acoustic tracks.
*   **Climax:**
    *   They watch a Wedding Highlight video playing at a slower, cinematic pace. The layout shifts to a warm collage style.
    *   Toey feels "relieved" and "impressed" that the same cinematographer can shift moods so effectively (Trust in versatility).
*   **Resolution:** Feeling they've found someone who understands both cool and sweet, they fill out the contact form (now titled "Tell us about your love story") to ask for package prices.

## 3. The Business Owner: "The 15-Minute Pitch" (Admin Journey)

*   **Persona:** "K.B" (35), Owner of 56konfilm, about to fly to Singapore for an urgent pitch.
*   **Opening Scene:** A Singapore client messages asking to see all "Cyberpunk" style works. K.B is at the airport with only 20 minutes before boarding.
*   **Rising Action:**
    *   K.B opens Sanity Studio on his iPad.
    *   Clicks "Create New Landing Page".
    *   Selects Template: "Commercial Project Grid".
*   **Climax:**
    *   He types "Cyberpunk" in the Media Library search. The system pulls up tagged clips.
    *   He drags and drops 4-5 clips into the block.
    *   Types a short intro and clicks Preview... The page renders beautifully as if it took a week to design.
*   **Resolution:**
    *   Clicks "Publish" (total time: 12 minutes).
    *   Copies the link and mocks it to the client via WhatsApp, then boards the plane with confidence (Operational Efficiency).
