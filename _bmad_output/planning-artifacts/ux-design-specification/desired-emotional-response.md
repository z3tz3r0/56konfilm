# Desired Emotional Response

## Primary Emotional Goals
*   **Awe (The Hook):** Users should feel immediate visual impact upon loading the site. The 60fps motion and full-screen video should signal "top-tier quality" instantly.
*   **Playfulness (The Switch):** The toggle between modes shouldn't just be functional; it should be fun. We want users to click it back and forth just to watch the world transform, creating a sense of delight and discovery.
*   **Confidence (The Content):** Whether an Agency Producer or a Bride, the user must feel absolute confidence in 56konfilm’s ability to deliver. The UX must scream "professional competence."

## Emotional Journey Mapping
1.  **Arrival (Anticipation):** User lands. Fast load time + Hero Video Loop builds anticipation. *Feeling: "Who are these people? This looks expensive."*
2.  **Exploration (Immersion):** User scrolls. Video cards play on hover/scroll. *Feeling: "The work is alive. I want to see more."*
3.  **The Switch (Surprise):** User clicks the toggle. The site morphs. *Feeling: "Wow, they can do BOTH? That's impressive technology."*
4.  **Conversion (Trust):** User reads the "About" or "Services" section (which matches their mode). *Feeling: "They get me. I'm ready to contact them."*

## Micro-Emotions
*   **Commercial Mode:** *Intensity, Precision, Edge.* The dark theme and sharp motion should make the user feel like they are working with a cutting-edge studio.
*   **Wedding Mode:** *Warmth, Romance, Intimacy.* The light theme and gentle fades should make the user feel safe and emotionally understood.
*   **Admin Mode:** *Power, Mastery, Relief.* The owner should feel "I am in control of my brand" when using the easy drag-and-drop backend.

## Design Implications
*   **To evoke "Intensity" (Commercial):** Use high-contrast typography (All Caps), rapid transition timings (0.3s), and dark backgrounds.
*   **To evoke "Romance" (Wedding):** Use serif/elegant typography, slower transition timings (0.8s), and abundance of negative space/light.
*   **To evoke "Power" (Admin):** Ensure the CMS preview is 100% accurate to the frontend. Nothing kills the feeling of mastery like a "broken preview."

## Emotional Design Principles
*   **Atmosphere over Information:** We prioritize *feeling* the vibe of the video over reading dense text.
*   **Interaction is Magic:** Every click and hover should have a response. A dead interface kills the emotional momentum.
*   **Respect the Context:** Never show "Commercial" aggression in "Wedding" mode, and vice versa. The emotional wall between the two worlds must be absolute until the user chooses to switch.
