# Retrospective: Epic 2 - The Cinematic Showcase
**Date:** 2026-02-03
**Participants:** Z3tz3r0 (Lead), Bob (SM), Alice (PO), Charlie (Dev), Dana (QA)

## 📊 Sprint Statistics

| Category | Metric | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Completion Rate** | **100%** (5/5 Stories) | All planned work finished on time. |
| **Quality** | **Green** | Automated tests passed (Mock Routes strategy effective). |
| **Velocity** | **High** | Improved "Rhythm" significantly via multi-agent loop. |

## 🏆 What Went Well (Success Factors)

### 1. Multi-Agent Workflow ("The Rhythm")
- **Observation:** Switching to a specialized Agentic loop (different from the main coding model) for complex implementation proved highly effective.
- **Impact:** Reduced context switching and increased code accuracy, specifically for Story 2.4 (Admin Drag & Drop) and logic-heavy components.
- **Quote:** *"Roundนี้รู้สึกว่าใช้ bmad ได้คล่องขึ้นแล้วก็ โดยรวมแล้วก็ให้ Agent อีกตัวนึงเป็นคนแก้โค้ดไปเลยไม่ได้ใช้โมเดลตัวเดิมในการแก้โค้ด"* - Z3tz3r0

### 2. Feature Implementation Wins
- **Magazine Layouts (Story 2.1):** Successfully integrated a modular Page Builder for Projects, enabling rich, flexible storytelling.
- **Hybrid Media Gallery (Story 2.2):** Overcame initial `autoplay` challenges using `motion/react` and `useInView` for performant, intersection-based playback.
- **Admin UX (Story 2.4):** Multi-drag-and-drop implementation significantly improved the Content Admin's workflow efficiency.

### 3. Testing Strategy
- **Mock Routes:** Adoption of mock routes for testing video behaviors proved more stable than previous network interception methods.

## 🐢 What Could Be Better (Challenges)

- **Sanity Schema Gaps:** During content population validation, we realized some schemas (like `contactFormSection` and a dedicated `LogoGrid` for Services) were missing or inconsistent with the high-fidelity design assets.
- **Design Fidelity:** Need closer alignment between "Design Asset" audit and "Schema Definition" phase to prevent these gaps in future epics.

## 💡 Lessons Learned

1. **Agent Specialization:** Continue delegating complex implementation tasks to specialized sub-agents/loops rather than forcing a single context to do everything.
2. **Schema Audit First:** Before marking an Epic as "Ready", verify that ALL design sections have a corresponding sanity schema type.

## 📝 Action Items

- [ ] **Immediate:** Create **Story 3.2 (Smart Contact Form Routing)** to address the missing contact form section identified during the audit.
- [ ] **Process:** Add a "Schema Gap Check" step to the `create-story` workflow analysis.

## ⏭️ Next Steps

**Transition to Epic 3: Wedding Mode & Conversion**
- **Priority:** Story 3.2 (Smart Contact Form Routing).
- **Focus:** implementing the "Emotional Layer" (Wedding Mode) and ensuring seamless context switching.
