# GEMINI AI Documentation

This project utilizes advanced AI agents (Antigravity/Gemini) for development, maintenance, and architectural guidance.

## Agent Context

The agents are powered by the **BMAD (Business Master Agentic Development)** framework, which provides a structured approach to AI-assisted coding.

### Configuration

- **Core Config**: `_bmad/core/config.yaml`
- **MCP Config**: `~/.gemini/antigravity/mcp_config.json`
- **Output Artifacts**: `_bmad-output/`

### Interaction Guidelines

When interacting with the AI agents:
1.  **Use Workflows**: Prefer the slash commands (e.g., `/bmad_bmm_dev-story`) for complex tasks.
2.  **Refer to Documentation**: Ensure `project-context.md` (generated by `/bmad_bmm_document-project`) is up to date.
3.  **Code Standards**: Agents follow the technical stack defined in `README.md` and `AGENTS.md`.
